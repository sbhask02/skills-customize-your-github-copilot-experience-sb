# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses, gaining experience with modern web development tools.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Initialize a new FastAPI project and set up the basic application structure.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main Python file with a FastAPI app instance
- Add a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message

### 🛠️ Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., items or users) supporting Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define a Pydantic model for the resource
- Add endpoints for POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE
- Store data in a Python list or dictionary (no database required)
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses

### 🛠️ Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using an HTTP client (e.g., curl, Postman, or FastAPI's interactive docs).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Demonstrate example requests and responses for each endpoint
- Include sample curl commands or screenshots of interactive docs
